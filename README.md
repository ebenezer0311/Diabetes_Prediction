# Diabetes_Prediction
### Introduction
- In this notebook, we would be doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset, which involves examining and understanding the data before applying any machine learning algorithms or making any predictions. EDA allows us to gain insights, detect patterns, and identify relationships within the dataset.
- Our goal is to extract meaningful information from the data and uncover any interesting findings or trends that can guide our decision-making process. By plotting various graphs and visualizations, we can effectively explore the dataset and derive valuable insights.

### Summary of the dataset
- this dataset contains medical and demographic data of patients along with their diabetes status, whether positive or negative. It consists of various features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.
